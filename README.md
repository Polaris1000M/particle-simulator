# Physics Simulator
Building a performant physics simulator from scratch in C with OpenGL, GLAD, GLFW, and cglm.
- Traverse through the scene with keyboard and cursor controls
- Allow users to save and load previous configurations
- **[in progress]** Handle millions of concurrent objects through compute shaders
- **[in progress]** Model collisions and forces between cubes, spheres, and triangular prisms
- **[in progress]** Allow users to add new particles to the simulation in real time
- **[in progress]** Allow users to specify calculations for forces between objects
- **[in progress]** Create custom GUI for easier use and modeling
